ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Reva (pronounced *Ray-vah*) â€” a fully funded Master of Science in Engineering (MSE) student in Computer Science at [Princeton University](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/), where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Manoel Horta Ribeiro](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~manoel/).

My research interests broadly concern social media and lie at the intersection of natural language processing, social computing, and computational social science.

Prior to Princeton, I earned my BSc in Software Engineering from [George Mason University](https://cs.gmu.edu/) (Spring 2025), where I was part of the NLP group led by [Antonios Anastasopoulos](https://cs.gmu.edu/~antonis/).

I've also had the privilege of working with [Jason Eisner](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~jason/) through the Frederick Jelinek Memorial Summer Workshop on Speech and Language Technology at the [Johns Hopkins University Center for Speech and Language Processing (CLSP)](https://www.clsp.jhu.edu/).
